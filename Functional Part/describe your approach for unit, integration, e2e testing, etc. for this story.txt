For Unit testing:
    - One Assertion in One Test Method(Test should always check 1  use-case only)
    - Minimize Test Interdependency(Test should run in any order, no relation or dependencies between tests)
    - Automate the Unit tests
    - Good naming convention(In case of failure QA can understand which module is failing)
    - No logic in the test ( keep the test simple without any conditions, loops etc)
    - Deterministic test (The test should give the same result everytime when you run until unless the code is changed)

For Integration testing(smoke tests):
    - Perform this test to make sure integrated module/component is working properly
        ( check shopping basket, Favourite Brand, pagination, loading of results) 
    - This can help to find bugs at an earlier state
    - If not all modules are developed, mock the data to test the same

For E2E tesing:
    - I would prioritize the End Use of the feature.(Design the test case accourdingly).
    - I will try avoiding edge cases
    - try to categorize and run/maintian test in order
    - Always try to have the set-up of test environment and tear down automated
